              When care is needed at home, families often have to coordinate many moving parts —
              professionals, equipment, schedules and clinical requirements. P. R. India Health
              Services exists to bring those pieces together.

              Our focus is home healthcare and critical-care support: home nursing services, doctor
              home visits, attendant care, home physiotherapy, home ICU setup and critical care
              equipment — coordinated around each patient's individual requirements and delivered
              with a genuinely human approach.
